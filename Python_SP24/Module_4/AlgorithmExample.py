# Algorithm Example
'''
An algorithm is a step-by-step problem-solving process in which a solution
is arrived at in a finite amount of time. It includes analyzing a problem,
outlining the steps required, and designing the steps. 

Think of an algorithm as an outline to your solution.
Your algorithm should be detailed enough so that you can easily
create the Python code from the steps listed.

Program Description:

We need to calculate the perimeter and area of a rectangle
based on a length and width that we input from a user.

Algorithm (Overview):

    Get:  length
    Get: width
    Set: perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
    Set: area = length * width
    Display: perimeter and area

Algorithm (Detailed):

    Input the length of the rectangle in the variable length
    Input the width of the rectangle in the variable width
    Calculate the perimeter of the rectangle as follows:
    perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
    Calculate the area of the rectangle as follows:
    area = length * width
    Display "Area = "
    Display the result in the variable area
    Display "Perimeter = "
    Display the result in the variable perimeter
